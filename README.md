# Flappy-Bird

Pretty self-explanatory, a flappy bird game.

The game implements both KeyListener and MouseListener, but as of 5/27/2025, only the KeyListener is used by the code
while the mouseListener simply prints a statement if a mousebutton is pressed.

Press SPACE to move the flappy bird up, avoid hitting the pipes, and enjoy the music!
